	<!--About this page:

This project unbrands Coca-Cola’s corporate identity through critiquing their environmental energy consumption and their hidden language. Coca-Cola’s branding emphasizes refreshment, happiness, and the experience of drinking beverages ice-cold, yet this  depends on frigeration systems, global transportation networks, and continuous energy use.

By transforming recognizable brand elements into visuals that highlight energy waste, this makes viewers reconsider how corporate branding can change environmental impact.-->

<!--Portions of CSS related to margin and positioning were referenced from: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp

// These resources were used to understand how margin affects layout flow and how background images are applied and scaled in CSS. Code was also provided from the book or learned from examples in class. -->

<!--What I learned from this assignment: Margin-top moves the text up or down on the page (negative values move it upward). Margin-left shifts the text horizontally to the right. The <div id="photos"> acts as a container for the refrigerator image. Instead of using an <img> tag for the fridge, a background-image is applied in CSS. I had isses with my fridge image getting cropped. So I used Background-size to ensures the full image fits inside the div without being cropped. Background-repeat: no-repeat prevents the image from tiling. Background-position: center keeps it centered inside the box. The .logo class styles the Coca-Cola logo image inside the div. Display: block allows margin spacing to work properly, and margin-left/margin-top adjust its placement on the page. The #photos:hover rule changes the background image when the user moves their mouse over the fridge, creating an interactive effect that supports the environmental critique.-->
