<p>Welcome to my Ariana Grande fan website!!!</p>

<!--
I got this marquee moving text idea from seeing old business websites that were going out of business. I don't have URLs to show, but it would noranally say, "50% off of....". I used this tag because I thought it looked better than having a standstill website. I wanted it to move so that my audience's eyes quickly look at that message.
